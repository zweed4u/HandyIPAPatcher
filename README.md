# HandyIPAPatcher

Shell scripts to extract thin binaries from IPA, patch with modified ones and then prepare for deploying.<br>

<b>extract_thin.sh</b> - Extracts thin binaries from already decrypted app.ipa file, if needed also with all framework binaries.
<b>replace_bin.sh</b> - Packs all binaries into app.ipa, if frameworks work directory was created by <b>extract_thin.sh</b> it will replace those binaries as well. If necessary it can also remove plugins if there are some signing issues.

It's convenient tool to swiftly repack .ipa to assist with patching binaries.
